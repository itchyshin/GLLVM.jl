# Generic Laplace-approximated marginal log-likelihood for non-Gaussian GLLVM
# families. The family-specific pieces — the Fisher-scoring score and weight, the
# μ clamp, and the conditional log-density — dispatch on the Distributions family
# type, so Binomial, Poisson, … share one mode-finder (no hardcoded family switch).
#
# Model (site s): y_{ts} ~ Family(μ_{ts}[, n_{ts}]),  μ = linkinv(link, η),
#     η = β_t + (Λ z_s)_t,  z_s ~ N(0, I_K).
# The marginal ∫ p(y_s|z) N(z;0,I) dz (non-conjugate) is computed by Laplace:
# find the conditional mode ẑ by Fisher scoring (expected Hessian ⇒ Λ'WΛ + I
# is always SPD), then  log p(y_s) ≈ ℓ(ẑ) − ½ẑ'ẑ − ½ logdet(Λ'WΛ + I).
#
# Each family provides, dispatched on its type:
#   _clamp_mu(family, μ)              domain-safe μ
#   _glm_score(family, μ, n, me, y)   ∂ℓ/∂η contribution (score)
#   _glm_weight(family, μ, n, me)     Fisher information wrt η (≥ 0)
#   _glm_logpdf(family, μ, n, y)      conditional log-density
# (see families/binomial.jl, families/poisson.jl).

# η clamp is family-agnostic; μ clamp dispatches on the family.
_clamp_eta(η) = clamp(η, -30.0, 30.0)

# Robust linear solve: returns `nothing` if the factorization is singular or
# fails, so the inner Newton can stop gracefully. A = Λ'WΛ + I is SPD by
# construction but can be numerically singular when the Fisher weights blow up
# (huge μ at the η clamp — e.g. a Poisson rate driven to exp(30)).

    nothing

Laplace-approximated log-marginal for one site of a non-Gaussian GLLVM. `family`
is a `Distributions` family marker (e.g. `Binomial()`, `Poisson()`); `y`, `n` are
the response and trial counts (length p; `n` is ignored by families without
trials); `Λ` p×K; `β` length-p; `link` a `Link`. `mask` (length-p Bool, or
`nothing`) marks observed responses — masked-out (missing) entries are dropped from
the score, the Hessian weight, and the log-density sum. Returns
`ℓ(ẑ) − ½ẑ'ẑ − ½logdet(Λ'WΛ + I)`.

"""
    marginal_loglik_laplace(family, Y, N, Λ, β, link; mask=nothing, offset=nothing, kwargs...) -> Float64

Total Laplace log-marginal over the `n` sites (columns) of a non-Gaussian GLLVM.
`Y`, `N` are p×n response and trial-count matrices. `mask` (p×n Bool, or `nothing`)
marks observed cells — missing responses (`mask` false) are dropped per site, so the
marginal is over the observed entries only (gllvm-style NA handling). The value is
invariant to whatever placeholder sits in the masked cells of `Y`.

`offset` (p×n, or `nothing`) is a known additive term in the linear predictor
`η = β + offset + Λz` (e.g. log-exposure/effort/area for counts). A constant
per-species offset is equivalent to shifting that species' intercept (the
offset-absorption identity), which serves as the exact verification anchor.
